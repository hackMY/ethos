HackMY recruitment flow
=======================

## Capability/Coding interview (remote/on-prem)
#### Interviewer: Engineer/Senior Engineer from HackMY pool

1. Capacity for adaptation + learning
  - Able to talk through approaches to grok-ing a new system when presented with one.
    - i.e. Given a simple pub-sub implementation in a language they understand, she is able to talk through why the implementation is written in the way it is, and how she would make it better.
    - Given a simple project in a language he DOES NOT know, is able to talk through how he would figure out what the piece of code does (or, given less time constraints, would actually go through the motions of figuring it out.)
1. Demonstrable implementation capability
  - At least one (1) medium-sized project (able to support 400+ users) that they have implemented in the past. This project should be sent in for code-review at least one (1) week prior to the coding interview, so the interviewer has time to have a look through and ask relevant questions.
    - Hackathon projects are acceptable, but should be able to be demonstrated, or talked through.
1. Is passionate about something
  - She shows a strong interest in a subject, and there is real-world data to support this interest (blog posts, projects, idea sketches). Given the chance, she can talk about this for hours and hours on end.
1. Passes the "Airport test"
  - If the interviewer was stuck in an airport with the candidate for 6 hours, without any electronic devices, would they be able to have meaningful conversation with the candidate, and vice versa?

## Fit interview (on-prem with company)
#### Timeline: Preferrably 1-1.5 weeks (max) after Capability interview
#### Interviewer: Direct manager of candidate (once hired)

1. Culture Fit
  - How much of a fit is the candidate with the target company?
  - Does the candidate believe in the reason for the company existing?
  - Does the candidate have a particular project/division they are interested in working on/in at the company?
1. [Company-specific questions]
