HackMY reasons for existing
===========================

## Problems we are solving
- Hiring is hard.
- The double-coincidence problem for finding good staff is an open problem.
- There is no unified pipeline for acquiring and finding good tech talent.
- Learning to hire is a valuable skill that every member of a company should be possess and be involved in.

## Why it makes sense to unify the pipeline
- Requirements for software engineers generally overlap from company to company.
- Unified marketing makes it a lot more simpler to gain exposure to more candidates.
- Removes discrepancies in hiring practices.
- Enables companies that may not have experience in hiring tech talent to participate and potentially hire great talent.
