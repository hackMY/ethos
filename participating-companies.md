What we want from participating companies
=========================================

1. Commitment to providing their engineers into the hiring interviewer pool.
  - Hiring is a skill you want everyone in your company to have, because ultimately the candidate will be working alongside these engineers in your company.
  - Your engineers are the domain experts in your product, so it follows that they should be the people best positioned to find other people who will help grow your product.

1. Commitment to filling positions in a timely manner
  - Great candidates are not going to wait around for offers. As such, we'd like to push for a decision preferably within 3 days of the Fit interview (see [Candidate Flow](candidate-flow.md)) in order to set the standard for HackMY as well as attract more great candidates to apply.
